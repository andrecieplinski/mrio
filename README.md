Multi-Regional Input-Output

This module will implement a multi-regional input-output model for PyPSA countries to improve connection between energy and economy. Initially we intend to convert exogenous GDP projection for different countries/world regions into more detailed industry level intermediate and total output. Moreover, we'll use data to convert monetary intermediate and final demands into demands for different energy sources tied to different industries in the input-output model.  

We'll use global open source data such as WIOD ( www.wiod.org), EORA (https://worldmrio.com) and EXIOBASE (https://www.exiobase.eu).

Our plan is to provide a blank canvas tha will allow researchers to extend the economic module in the future and increase the number of interconnections and feedbacks between energy and economy.
